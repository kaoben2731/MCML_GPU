<h2 id="exec">Execute the Program</h2>

Use this command to run this program:
`./MCML_GPU sim_set.json input.txt output.txt <option(s)>`
### [sim_set.json](#sim_set)
a .json file for setting parameters
### [input.txt](#input_txt)
the input file to set optical parameters for each layer
### [output.txt](#output_txt)
the output filename for reflectance
### options
#### -h
Print the helping information
#### -R
Replay the detected photons after first simulation, to get the pathlength in each layer or absorbance matrix.
With this option, there will be output of [A_rz_SDS_#.txt](#arz_txt) and [A0_z_SDS_#.txt](#a0z_txt)
#### -P
Output the pathlength for each photon in [pathlength_SDS_#.txt](#PLSDS_txt), otherwise output the calculated average pathlength in [average_pathlength.txt](#avg_PL_txt)
#### -A
Calaulate and output the average pathlength
#### -B
Output the pathlength file in binary format for faster speed

###### radius:
the radius of this detector fiber, in cm

Set the optical parameters for each layer.

#### Rules:
* Each line for one simulation.
* Arrange in "height(cm) mu_a(1/cm) mu_s(1/cm) n g" for one layer.
* The last layer should have no height.
* 5 parameters for 1 layer, so n layer should be 5n-1 columns.
* The number of layers should be the same as "number_layers" in 
#### Example:
`0.27	0.3201	35.2861	1.4	0	0.65	0.2954	30.5833	1.4	0	0.2747	130.6813	1.4	0`
This is a 3 layer tissue, parameters for each layer are setting as below:

| layer    | height   | mu_a     | mu_s     | n        | g        |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1        | 0.27     | 0.3201   | 35.2861  | 1.4      | 0        |
| 2        | 0.65     | 0.2954   | 30.5833  | 1.4      | 0        |
| 3        | N/A      | 0.2747   | 130.6813 | 1.4      | 0        |

<h2 id="output_files">Output Files</h2>

<h3 id="output_txt">output.txt</h3>

The reflectance collected by each SDS.  One column is one SDS.

<h3 id="summary_json">Summary.json</h3>

Store the summary of this simulaiton.
#### num_photon
number of total simulated photon.
#### sim_time
The time cost to do the (first) simulate, in secs
#### replay_time
The time cost to do the second simulate and output the pathlength array, in secs
#### sim_speed(photons/s)
The average speed of simulation.
#### each_photon_weight
The initial weight of each photon at launch, when calculate WMC, the **[photon detected weight](#PLSDS_txt)** should be divided by this number.
#### SDS_detected_number
The number of photon detected by each detector.  The number of elements is the same as **num_SDS** in [sim_set.json](#simset_json).

<h3 id="PLSDS_txt">pathlength_SDS_#.txt or pathlength_SDS_#.bin</h3>

The pathlength information for each photon collected by SDS #, can be used to perform White MC.
#### Rules:
Each row is one photon.
The first column is the photon's weight when it been detected.
The second column to the second-last columns are the photon's pathlength (cm) in each tissue layer.
The last column is how many times did the photon scattered.
#### Example:
```
7155930	0.164281	2.99355	4.65341	570
6295.91	0.0202396	0.570237	0.312309	3036
827985	0.108664	2.41008	4.92397	1120
325157	0.225788	1.57377	4.2767	873
17125.5	0.0720376	1.84378	2.97216	2504
27530.4	0.106237	1.10873	1.53136	2460
```
Those are 6 detected photon with properties below:
| weight   | PL in L1 | PL in L2 | PL in L3 | scatter  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 7155930  | 0.164281 | 2.99355  | 4.65341  | 570      |
