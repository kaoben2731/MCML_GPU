Set the optical parameters for each layer.

* Rules:
    * Each line for one simulation.
    * Arrange in "height(cm) mu_a(1/cm) mu_s(1/cm) n g" for one layer.
    * The last layer should have no height.
    * 5 parameters for 1 layer, so n layer should be 5n-1 columns.
    * The number of layers should be the same as "number_layers" in 
* Example:
`0.27	0.3201	35.2861	1.4	0	0.65	0.2954	30.5833	1.4	0	0.2747	130.6813	1.4	0`
This is a 3 layer tissue, parameters for each layer are setting as below:

| layer    | height   | mu_a     | mu_s     | n        | g        |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1        | 0.27     | 0.3201   | 35.2861  | 1.4      | 0        |
| 2        | 0.65     | 0.2954   | 30.5833  | 1.4      | 0        |
| 3        | N/A      | 0.2747   | 130.6813 | 1.4      | 0        |

<h3 id="PLSDS_txt">pathlength_SDS_#.txt or pathlength_SDS_#.bin</h3>

The pathlength information for each photon collected by SDS #, can be used to perform White MC.
* Rules:
    * Each row is one photon.
    * The first column is the photon's weight when it been detected.
    * The second column to the second-last columns are the photon's pathlength (cm) in each tissue layer.
    * The last column is how many times did the photon scattered.
* Example:
```
7155930	0.164281	2.99355	4.65341	570
6295.91	0.0202396	0.570237	0.312309	3036
827985	0.108664	2.41008	4.92397	1120
